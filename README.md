# Bank Loan Approval Prediction With Artificial Neural Nets

## Sponsored by Foundation For Excellence through Coursera Project Works

Welcome to the "Bank Loan Approval Prediction With Artificial Neural Nets" project! This hands-on project is designed to provide you with practical experience in building and training a deep neural network model to predict the approval of personal loans based on various features.

## What You'll Learn

1. Understand the theory and intuition behind Deep Neural Networks.
2. Build and train a deep learning model using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend.
3. Assess the performance of the trained model and ensure its generalization using various Key Performance Indicators.

## Skills You'll Practice

- Artificial Neural Networks
- Deep Learning
- Machine Learning

## About this Guided Project

In this project sponsored by Foundation For Excellence through Coursera Project Works, you will:

- Understand the applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques in the banking industry.
- Import key Python libraries, datasets, and perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Perform data visualization using Seaborn.
- Standardize the data and split them into train and test datasets.
- Build a deep learning model using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend.
- Assess the performance of the model and ensure its generalization using various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
